# JavascriptQuiz


## Description
This is a quiz built using javascript, html, and css. When the page is loaded, there is a start button, which, when clicked, will provide the user with the first questions and start a timer. If the correct answer is chosen, the user will be brought to the next question. If the user chooses the wrong questions, the timer will lose 10 seconds, and will not move to the next question until the correct one is chosen. Once the user answers all the questions correctly, they will be given a score (the leftover time), and a text box to input their name. This name and score will be stored in a "highscores" tab that will locally save all of the highscores.
